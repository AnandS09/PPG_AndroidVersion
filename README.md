# PPG_AndroidVersion
Android application to demonstrate real time PPG using OpenCV

Since this is an experimental version, please ensure that you have the latest open cv manager installed on your android device.
Otherwise the app will simply crash. 
Use this link to download OpenCV Manager : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.opencv.engine&hl=en

Once you are all set and ready to fire do the following. 
1. Launch the app
2. Keep your finger on the top of the camera lens. Make sure the camera preview is all red, otherwise measurements will suffer due to external noise. 
3. After roughly 30-40secs you should have a reliable BPM information.

IMPORTANT. The final stage is still WIP so you will not be able to see the BPM. 
However presently we are showing the frame information live in the app so go ahead and give it a try :)
